# Udacity Front End Nanodegree  | Classic Arcade Game

Bugger Game/Arcade game
This game is similar game of the classic "Frogger" game. Like Frogger, you move your character across traffic, avoiding the icky bugs, to get to the safe zone (water at the top of the page).

I built this game as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program
This is project 4 of the Google Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Google Scholarship, and it is one of the javascript challenges ;)

## Play this game here: https://melsdesign.github.io/Arcade-Game/

# How to play
There are 3 areas of this game world:

At the top, the water
In the middle, the path
At the bottom, the grass
The player begins with 3 lives

# Instructions
In this game, you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). 
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without touching any one of the enemies. 
The player can move left, right, up and down with the keyboard arrows. 
The enemies move at varying speeds 
Once a player touches the  enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting point. 
Once the player reaches the water three times the game is won.
The player has 3 lives. Every time he collides with an enemy a life is lost.

When all lives are lost the game ends with a dialog showing the score.

I hope you enjoy it ;)
